C Programming Basic Algorithm
1. Write a C program to compute the sum of the two input values. If the two values are the same, then return triple their sum.
2. Write a C program that will take a number as input and find the absolute difference between the input number and 51. If the input number is greater than 51, it will return triple the absolute difference.
3. Define a structure named Time with members hours, minutes, and seconds. Write a C program to input two times, add them, and display the result in proper time format.
