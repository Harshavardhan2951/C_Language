C Programming Basic Algorithm
Write a C program to compute the sum of the two input values. If the two values are the same, then return triple their sum.
Write a C program that will take a number as input and find the absolute difference between the input number and 51. If the input number is greater than 51, it will return triple the absolute difference.
Define a structure named Time with members hours, minutes, and seconds. Write a C program to input two times, add them, and display the result in proper time format.
Write a C Program to take inputs of Structs using Pointers
Write a C program using struct to print the info of the fields mentioned within the struct by using struct in function
Write a C program that takes n number of positive integers. Find the integer that appears the least number of times among the said integers. If there are multiple such integers, select the smallest one.
Write a C program that takes a string and two integers (n1, n2). Now reverse the sequence of characters in the string between n1 and n2.
Write a C program that accepts three integers from the user and finds the second largest number among them.
Write a C program that accepts a sequence of different values and calculates the sum of the values before and after the maximum value.The sum of the values before the maximum value is 0, if there are no values before the maximum. Similarly, the sum of the values after the maximum value is 0, if there are no values after the maximum.
